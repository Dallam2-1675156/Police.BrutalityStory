    <h2>When taking into account populations, an unarmed black person is 3X more likely to be shot than an unarmed white person. Where you live matters as well, where some rates of Black people being shot is higher than other places. This is due to the differences in precincts, the policies put in place, the training received and the tactics taught to police officers. There is also a variation in steps police officers have to take before shooting a person. Less than 25% of police departments requires police officers to exhaust all other means before shooting. Less than 5% of police departments requires police officers to give a warning before shooting.</h2>

    <h2>The disparities on the amount of Black people killed in compared to the rest of the races may be 0 or lower due to lack of Black a population in that area. For example, in Vermont, the percent of the population that is Black is 1%. So a 0% of victims that are Black are killed, the disparity is a -1%. In places such as Alabama where the percentage of Black population is 26.18%, but the percentage of victims that are Black is 38%, we now have a 12% disparity. Rhode Island is the highest disparity, where the population of Black people is 5.72% of the entire population of Rhode Island. 50% of the victims killed by police are Black. This results in a 44% disparity.</h2>
